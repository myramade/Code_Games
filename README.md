Hi Friends! 

Welcome to my list of Games that Teach! If you follow me on [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@learnwithmyra) you may have seen a few of my videos where I shared a few of these games. If you found me through other social media links - glad you're here. I have a few criteria for this list of games:
1. They should be educational - ya learn something
2. They should be FREE or cost no more than $10 USD
3. They should be be gated behind a registration wall (although there is one gated game but it's still free)
4. They should be fun or interesting to play

If you have a game you'd like to have me add to the list, message me on [Linkedin](http://linkedin.com/in/myraroldan)
